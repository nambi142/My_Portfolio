            <p>
            I'm a front-end developer skilled in React.js, JavaScript, and modern
            UI design. I completed a React-focused internship and built several
            hands-on projects, including an e-commerce site and a personal
            portfolio. I enjoy creating responsive, user-friendly web applications
            and continuously expanding my skills.
